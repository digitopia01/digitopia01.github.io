# How much sleep does your child need?

[Babycenter](http://www.babycenter.com/) is an extremely resourceful site if you’ve or expecting a child. Here is another gem that might just give you an overall idea of [How much sleep your child need?](http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sleep-does-your-child-need_7645.bc)

It is advised that most kids will need lots of sleep. BabyCenter’s sleep expert Jodi Mindell, “if a child has poor sleep habits or refuses to go to bed before 11 at night, her parents will think that she just doesn’t need a lot of sleep. That’s probably not true — in fact, it’s likely that such a child is actually sleep-deprived.”

To see whether your child falls into that camp, ask yourself these questions:

- Does your child fall asleep almost every time she’s in a car?
- Do you have to wake your child almost every morning?
- Does your child seem cranky, irritable, or overtired during the day?
- On some nights, does your child seem to crash much earlier than his usual bedtime?

If you answered “yes” to any of these, your child may be getting less sleep than she needs. Read the [article in full](http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sleep-does-your-child-need_7645.bc) at Babycenter.
