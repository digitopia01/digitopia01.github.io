Amara, Laaija, and Shanta went to Manipur for the Summer break in early April. The COVID Pandemic Second Wave was weaning down in all major cities in India.

Unfortunately, the whole situation was beginning to unfold in Manipur. The state went on lockdowns – semi to complete – in a constant state of fear and the unknown.

It became pretty bad that the whole family got COVID – no complications, but we did. We were fine after two weeks of quarantine.

Amara, Laaija, and Shanta tested `COVID-Positive` on Aug 6, 2021. Everyone were later tested `COVID-Negative` on Aug 25, 2021.

Brajeshwar stayed back in Bangalore and has so far been negative in all tests done periodically.
