Went to consult the physician for Laaija’s skin irritant that have started appearing on her hands and legs. Though they’re minute and not that really noticeable; she tends to scratch them at times. With her recent development of some asthmatic symptoms, I was worried if the situation will go chronic.

**Maternal Side**

Laaija’s maternal genetic have a history of Asthma. Shanta’s parents and relatives are known to have Asthma issues and even she is allergic to dust. Her’s not severe but it does happen at times when cold or exposed to dust. So, the very likelihood of Laaija developing some form of Asthma exist and we’re keeping an eye on the allergens.

**Paternal Side**

Of course not. I’ve never heard any history of Asthma in our family, relatives or anyone. In fact, my parents, uncles, and their cousins were farmers, truck drivers and have mostly engaged in some form of peasantry occupation. I grew up amongst mud, dirt and what not. I remember fishing in the muddiest water, leading any cleaning squad that happens in our locality. I’ve even plowed gardens, carried mud, sand and have done many dirt-cleaning things to earn pocket money. So, no question of Asthma from my side.

**Atopic Dermatitis**

Atopic Dermatitis is the medical term for the inflammatory skin disease which also goes by the names of — “prurigo Besnier,” “neurodermitis,” “endogenous eczema,” “flexural eczema,” “infantile eczema,” and “prurigo diathsique”.

There are, so far, no cure for AD. It can, however, be treated very effectively in the short term through a combination of prevention (learning what triggers the allergic reactions) and drug therapy.

**Preventive Measures**

Here are some of the preventive measures advised by doctors.

**Diet:**

Many common food allergens can trigger an allergic reaction: such as milk, nuts, cheese, tomatoes, wheat, yeast, soy, and corn. Many of these allergens are common ingredients in grocery store products (especially corn syrup, which is a sugar substitute). Breastfeeding is the best way to avoid these problems, but if that is unavailable, then hydrolyzed formulas are preferred to cow’s milk.

**Environment and Lifestyle:**

Since dust is a very common allergen and irritant, try to stay away from dust and live in a clean environment. The dander from the fur of dogs and cats may also trigger an inflammatory response. It is a common misconception that simply removing an animal from a room will prevent an allergic reaction from occurring. A room must be completely free of animal dander in order to prevent an allergic reaction. Anger, stress, and lack of sleep are also factors that are known to aggravate AD. Excessive heat (especially with humidity) and coldness are known to provoke outbreaks, as well as sudden and extreme temperature swings.

Stay away from fragrance and other cosmetic products, specially those that produces mist. Most commercial soaps wash away all the oils produced by the skin that normally serve to prevent drying. Using a soap substitute such as aqueous cream helps keep the skin moisturized. Showers should be kept short and at a lukewarm/moderate temperature.

Let’s see how things turn out.
