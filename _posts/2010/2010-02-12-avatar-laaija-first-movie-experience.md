> [Avatar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/) is a science fiction epic film written and directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Stephen Lang.

The film is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on the lush moon Pandora in the Alpha Centauri star system. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na’vi — a sentient humanoid species which is indigenous to Pandora. The film’s title refers to the genetically engineered Na’vi bodies used by several human characters to interact with the natives of Pandora.

Film critics across the globe have touted Avatar as a remarkable and historic moment in the world of Motion Picture. It was lucky that Leia’s first movie was Avatar in 3D. She was awe-struck and was trying to comprehend the enormous size of the new ‘big TV’.

However, during the forest scene where Jake Sully was fighting the ferocious animals of Pandora, Leia was frightened and cried. She later slept off for a while, later to wake up and continue watching the movie.

We were surprised that she’s perfectly OK in a movie theatre and we might take her to more movies soon.
