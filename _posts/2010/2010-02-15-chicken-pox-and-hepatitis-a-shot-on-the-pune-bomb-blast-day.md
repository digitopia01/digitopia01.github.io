Laaija got her Chicken Pox and Hepatitis A shots on **SAT, Feb 13, 2010**. Well, unfortunately, it was also the day when German Bakery at Koregaon Park, Pune was Bomb Blasted around 7pm in the evening. Fortunately, we missed the whole episode as we left the Clinic, located about 100 yards or so from German Bakery, around 6:30 pm.
