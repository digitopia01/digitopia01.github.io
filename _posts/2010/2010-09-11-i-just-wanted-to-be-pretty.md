# I just wanted to be pretty

We all went to see Dabang, a Salman Khan movie and was good laugh, nice entertainment. Leia watched the movie from start to finish, enjoying every bit of it — the dances, the fights, everything.

It seemed she learnt something from the Movie. She wanted to look prettier. Later in the evening, I realized there was no usual noise and messing around from her. Upon looking further, we caught her with her mom’s lipstick all over her lips and more.
