She was the cutest and the best thing that happened to me 10 years ago. She changed everything in my life — from the way I drive to the way I treat people to my overall approach in life. Without her, I might not have been able to face the uncertainties of a life that I chose to live.

10 years later, she is now a `rebel`. Or so she tries to portray. Even her friends think she is one and one of her recent birthday gifts was a book about rebel girls. I hope she stays that way. I’ll in-fact help her become what she wants without any imposition. If she thinks and wants to do something in an interesting direction, I’ll figure out ways if allowed, to help her achieve a 10x.
