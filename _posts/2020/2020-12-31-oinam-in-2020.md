It started as just another normal year, with a tint of worry about the new of the emergence of COVID-19. Like everyone else, we heard and read of the new scary virus. By the end of January, Laaija had already decided to wear mask regularly to school. Her school told her not to but I guess, she was right at the end. By April, 2020 mask has become a normal part of dressing up.

Laaija and her classmates built an [Eat-o-Meter](https://ekya.laaija.com), an app that supposedly scan food items, and displays the calorie, and other contents of the particular food item.

Amara had a tiny accident and had a hariline fracture in her collarbone. This is the second time, and so we took extra care. She is fine, and will heal pretty fast and well.

I visited Pune and the first place where Nanocast, Inc started its office in Pune. This is the place where my life of Startups started at Koregaon Park, Pune.

I spoke at few conferences, and gatherings with Indian and Japanese delegates. I'm trying to focus on the relationship between Climate Change and Agriculture, helping farmers farm better, in a sustainable way, and still be able to earn better to live fulfilled lives.

After a long time, I re-visited [Rajasthan](https://brajeshwar.com/2004/rajasthan-desert-tour-dimpis-wedding/), this time for work. I visited my home-town, Manipur, too and met up with old friends.

In the midst of the Pandemic, I ended up reading about [100 books](https://brajeshwar.com/2020/books-of-2020/).

2020 was a masked year.
